            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17856:6"/> the two Kings attended with diuerse Noble men and others, ride to <hi>Eltham</hi> Parke hard by Greenewich, where his Maiestie hath a verie faire house, and there they hunted and killed Bucks, and so returned to the Court to Greenwich to dinner, where out King fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> most royally in the log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings appointed for the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> being the two great Towers and Galleries within the Tilt-yard, which were so well marshalled and contriued, that neither the numbers to be receiued found desease, the attendants trouble, nor the number of vaine gazers (in which our Nation is more rich then any Kingdome) want of their foolish eyes satisfaction, then for the accates and cheare, flesh, fish, foule, beare, ale, and wines of all sortes, it was so royally superabundant, that neyther malice nor detraction could say, but it was most worthily magnificent, and by the way in that so great a feast, where liberalitie with an open hande threwe inticing baites of surfaite abroad, which might euen haue drawne temperance it selfe to haue erred in his owne disposition: I gathered and obserued this note, that how euer the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke</hi> hath in precedent times, beene either commended or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the free-hearted intertainment, or to great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in drinke, yet these (I meane the meaner sort of this royall Kings followers, in whom euer is soonest discerned the most common errour) did showe at this great feast, where they could but wish and haue it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected‚ñ™ nay, where many men of many Nations, I knowe, would haue esteemed it more barbarous to haue refused drinke, then disgrace to bee drunke:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17856:6"/> such discreete temperance, refusing with such modest courtesie, and shunning surcharge, with such pleasing affabilitie, that in my conceit they exceeded the seuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Italian: sure I am, for our owne Nation, I haue neither at home, nor abroad seene them more modest, I may wel say no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> so respectiue, nay into such a beleefe, and expectation, had former reportes drawne mee, that their first abstinence I imputed to inacquaintance, feare of disgrace, and seueritie of more temperate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours: but when I sawe all those obstakles recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and freedome lent euen to the freenesse of their natures, I sawe them continue their good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and peacefull modestie vnder such a constant rule, that the meanest might some times bee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to some of ours, that haue or sue for much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re places.</p>
            <p>After dinner was ended, and sometime spent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two Kings in priuate, the King of <hi>Denmake</hi> came downe through the priuie Gardens into the Tennis-Court, where he sate and sawe diuerse sets played at the Tennis, betweene a French Gentleman and one <hi>Webbe</hi> an English Gentleman: and because I had in that Tennis-court, by reason that I stoode a good space opposite against his Maiestie, a perfite and full view of him, I will as neare as I can deliuer you his discription, according to mine owne coniecture.</p>
            <p>First, for his Maiesties stature, it is tall, but not of the tallest sort of men, such as a man shoulde make a question of a taller, but of that mediocritie of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is most pleasing in the eye and sense of the best iudgement: his haire is of a whitish
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17856:7"/> browne: his beard somewhat whiter then his head: his cheekes he keepeth smooth without haire: his haire vppon his chinne about three-fingers long, cutte of an euen cutte: in his cheekes hee hath a pure and fresh blood: his countenance cheerefull and amiable: his fore-heade white and hie: his eyes bright and liuely: In all; his face is full, rounde, and enriched with beautie: and to speake without errour, such and so like, that any one that hath beholde her, might chalenge him by the face of the Queenes Maiestie his Sister. Hee is of bodie strongly made, broade, large, and of the best composition, hee appeares bigge vnder his waste, hath an exceeding cleane made legge, and a delicate fine made foote: to conclude, his proportion shewes him to bee a man of greate strength, actiuitie, and indurance, such as are the markes of the best Conquerours. The apparell which that day he wore, was a Doublet &amp; Hose of a kinde of Bryer-ball coloured Satten, plaine, and onely cut with a byas cutte, the fashion, such as is at this day most of request in this Kingdome: hee wore a paire of white Silke Stockings, and a paire of blacke Spanish leather shooes: about his arme he wore a faire Scarfe, and on his heade he had a gray Beuer Hat, with a Hat-band of Pearle, and Diamonds set in Gold-smiths worke, and a Iewell of Diamonds, which held vp the right side brimme of his hat: in my conceyte of price not to bee valued.</p>
            <p>On Sunday being the twentieth day of Iulie, all Courtiers, euen from the best to the meanest, gaue their attendance in their best gallantrie, the Guarde
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17856:7"/> in their rich Coats, all studded ouer with studdes of Golde and Siluer, and faire guilt Halberts in their handes, stoode on each side from the presence Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, to the farther end of the long Gallery next to the Chappell: the Gentle-men Pencioners, some in cloth of Golde, some in cloth of Siluer, Veluet, or Satten layde with Golde or Siluer lace, the meanest all with guilt Pollaxes in their handes, armed with vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet, studded with Golde, and tasseld with coloured Silks &amp; Golde or Siluer, stood from the one end of the presence Chamber to the other, euen to the doore of the Lobby which goeth into the priuie Chamber: and when all thinges were in a readinesse, the Nobilitie and Counsaile of England, and the counsaile and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of <hi>Denmarke</hi> going two and two together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two kinges, verie rich, and in great state fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed through both the former Guards, to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: where after prayers ended, they returned againe into the presence in like statelye fashion, where that day our King feasted the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> in most sumptuous manner, Drummes beating, and Trumpets sounding ouer all the Pallace. Had a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger‚ñ™ starued wretch beene but brought thither, to haue behelde the aboundance of meate, without doubt I am perswaded it would haue filled his stomacke: euen plentie breeding a loath, and the open hande of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie stopping the mouth of Desire, insomuch that many refused, what they most craued, because it came so bountifully without asking; and what was most both to be admyred and praysed. Al this infinit worlde of abundance was gouerned by such a discreete and

            <p>On Munday the one and twentieth day of Iuly, both the Kinges hunted in <hi>Greenewich</hi> Parke, and dined at the White Tower on the top of the hill, in the Parke, the Earle of Northamton hauing the keeping thereof.</p>
            <p>Tuesday the xxij. of Iuly, and Wednesday the xxiij. were spent in hunting at <hi>Eltham</hi> and in feasting. On Thursday the foure and twentyeth of Iuly, both the Kinges with their traines, which contained great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, roade in progresse to <hi>Theobalds</hi> neare <hi>Waltham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelue miles from the Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> and being in the house of the moste Noble and worthie Earle of Salisburie, where vppon the approach of the Kinges Maiesties, there were manie verie learned, delicate, and significant showes and deuises presented vnto them, which I wil omitte amply to discribe, because my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture may erre from the drift of the inuentor, and I hould it a capitall offence by a sleight imagination to misconster a fayre inuention; and there is no doubt but the author thereof who hath his place equall with the best in those Artes, will himselfe at his leasurable howers publish it in the best perfection. Yet to giue you a little taste of what came nearest to my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there was at the entrance of the Gates, planted a goodly Tree with leaues, and other ornaments resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a great Oake: the leaues cut all out of greene

            <p>On friday being the fiue and twentieth day of Iuly, both the Kinges went and hunted the Stagge in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham Forrest, where the heat of the day, the dust from the earth, and the busie flies in the woodes, I thinke took from the Kinges maiestie of <hi>Denmarke</hi> the best part of his delight in the hunting: after they had kilde a brace or two of Staggs, they returned backe to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds,</hi> where they spent that night: and the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satterday, The six &amp; twentieth day of Iuly, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate mirth and feasting.</p>

            <p>The Kinges Maiesties in manner before prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, passed from Tower-streete downe Marke Lane, thence downe Fanchurch-streete, so vp Gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streete, and then downe Cornehill to the Conduite before the Royall Exchange, which that day ran with Claret-wine: vpon the toppe of the Royall Exchange sate all the Cittie Trumpetters, who during the Kings passage sounded their Trumpets most excellently: then the Kinges passed downe through the Poultrie, till they came to the great long Conduite in the neather ende of Cheapeside: vppon the toppe of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duite, was the modell of a faire Garden, and at one ende an Arbour most delicately made in the figure of a square Canapie, portraiting out in boughes the semblance of Pillars, Pinacles, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bost worke. This Arbor was all adorned with fruits of all so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This Conduite also that day ranne Claret-wine: from thence the Kings passed vp Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, till they came as hie as the Horse-head Tauerne, from whence there was made a Scaffolde of a prettie height, all lined, hung, and couered ouer heade with blewe cloath: In this Scaffolde sate the Recorder
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17856:13"/> of the Citie, and foure and twentie Aldermen all in their Scarlet Gownes: The Recorder vppon the two Kings approach descended from his seate, and made a most famous and worthie Oration: which ended, hee presented to the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> a most rich present as from the whole body of the Citie: this done, and the Recorder taking again his place, the two Kings ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as hie as the Old-change: from the corner of which street ouerthwart the whole breadth of Cheepside, was built and raised vp a most stately, and well conceyted Pegne, or Pageant, into the depth and secrets whereof I do not intend to wade, because it is expected to bee published presently by the Authour that made it, onely those tastes that mine eie did gather by the view, I will deliuer vnto you: First the middle part betweene the two Arches, for some ten or twelue foote hie from the ground, was represented a Sea, with sundrie Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Sea nymphs, and others singing within the same, and Musike consorting their voyces: ouer it as it were presenting the Ile of Britaine within the Sea, &amp; round about euen from the ground to the toppe, being as I coniectured aboue fortie foote, were nothing but crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie rocks, adorned with foure most stately Pyramides, which standing on each side the Arches, rise from the ground aboue the toppe of the Arches: Iust ouer the right hand Arch, was <hi>Neptune</hi> all in blew, with his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his hand, and mounted on a Sea-horse of siluer, sitting as in the Sea: ouer the left hand Arch likewise, in an other Sea-caue, sat <hi>Mulciber</hi> the god of Mettals with all such M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Ouer both these Arches the Rockes rose a great height, and were supported on each side by two great Giants: and on the toppes of those two Rockes stoode the Armes of great <hi>Bryttain</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> ioyned together, the one side supported by one of the Supporters of England, the other by one of the Supporters of <hi>Denmarke:</hi> betweene these Rockes rose a great height higher, like the heade of a fine Turret, with a Pyramides on the toppe of all, vnder which stoode the greate hatchment of greate <hi>Brittain,</hi> and within it sate enthroned (as I conceiued) the genious of Concorde: who vppon the neere approach of the Kings, was by a quaint deuise let downe in her throne, to the lower and middle concaue, where setting open her doores, and deliuering a long speech to the Kings, she discouered to their Maiesties the modell of a faire citie, and much other treasures: there sate the genious of the citie of London, who deliuered to the Kings a long speech in Latin, so did <hi>Neptune</hi> also: the Sea-Nymphs sang in Latin, and the musick was wondrous delightful: the Pageant was wondrously adorned with many guilt columbs, rich banners, &amp; guidons and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie shields, with sundrie learned deuices: after the kings were past through this Pageant, they came into <hi>Paules</hi> churh-yard, where ouer against <hi>Pauls</hi> schoole sat al the petty Canons &amp; singing mƒì belonging to the great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> amongst wh≈ç were mingled a c≈çsort of cornets, Sagbuts, &amp; other wind instrumƒìts: at <hi>Pauls</hi> schoole doore was a little scaffold reard &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with cloth of gold, from whence was a most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

            <p>The Kings might behold within the Arbour, a faire Shepheard courting a coy Shepherdesse, who had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him that she would loue him, when she could behold two Sunnes at one time of equall brightnesse: when there were two Maiesties of like splendor, or two Kings in one state, with many such like imagined im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, which now he shewed her were come to passe, approouing those two kings two glorious Suns, two Maiesties, and what else she had reputed impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: After these speeches which held a pretty space, the Musicke plaied, and there was another song sung of farewell: at the ende whereof, the Kings Maiesties departed, and so roade along through Fleetstreete to Temple-barre, where the Lord Maior of the Citie taking his humble leaue of the two Kings, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many gracious thanks, had the sworde deliuered him backe, and himselfe redeliuered the Scepter, and so withall the rest of his brethren, who mounted vpon their foote-cloathes, richly trapt in goldƒì trappers came to meete him, they departed into the Citie. The two Kings Maiesties in forme as at the first, keepe on their way from Temple-Barre, all through the Strande, so to Charing-crosse, and thence to White-hall, where dismounting about seauen of the clocke in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they feasted and reposed themselues there all that night.</p>
            <p>On Friday being the first day of August the Kings Maiestie of <hi>Denmarke</hi> being attended on by diuerse of our principall Nobilitie, past priuately to the Citie of London, vntill hee came to the greate Cathedrall Church of S. Paul, being onely to be admired for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17856:15"/> antiquitie, and hugenesse, rather for his beautie or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie, and yet there be some things beyond sodaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, as both his stately ascentions and the artificiall workemanship of diuers faire Windowes and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Tombs. Then his Maiestie went to the toppe of the steeple, from whence he might take the prospect and full view of the whole Citie, whose outstretched limmits I make no doubt, but inflamed him both with delight and admiration.</p>
            <p>After his Maiestie had beheld this famous Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he went to behold the Roiall Exchange, which being founded &amp; built at the charges of a subiect, may verie wel be ranckt and rekconed amongst the greatest Monuments preserued in any ferraine Nation: From thence his Maiestie went vntill he came to the Tower, where entring, he beheld the strengths, glories, riches, and other antient monuments preserued within that place, such as I do not think any christian king or other whatsoeuer is able to boast of any house c≈çparable to it in greatnes, strength, and most strange furnishmƒìts: one part of it containing the principall munition or store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house for al maner of warlike preparations, as ordinƒÅce of all sorts, euen fr≈ç the double Canon, to the hand Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll, &amp; all things whatsoeuer, which belongeth to any of their seueral vses: also horsmƒìs staues, pikes, halberts, browne bils, bowes, arrowes, armour innumerable, or what engines soeuer hath at any time been practised in our English wars: but to behold the infinite number of iron bullets of all sorts &amp; sises, made for the great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, lying in huge heaps, wold put an ignorant mind into much astonishment: there is in an other part, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17856:15"/> mint, &amp; places for the triall of mettals, a thing more thƒì strange to them that are not accustomed to such sights: in an other place are all the ancient records, charters, &amp; especial euidence of this kingdom: in another place, the wardrope, robes vsually worne by all the former kings and Queens of this nation, where if one obserue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral fashions, embroderies, cuts, adornations, riches beauty, brauery, &amp; comely plainnes, which time hath brought forth, altred, &amp; renued, it wold not only moue admire, but euen inchant with the weight of seuerall considerations: there is another part of the Tower, the treasurie or iewel house, which how it is fraught or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I haue herd diuers miraculously speak: but because I haue not with mine own eies beheld, I wil only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it is such, so excellent, &amp; not to be equalled, as wel may be seeme the dignitie and greatnes of so rich &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a kingdome: to c≈çclude, in this house which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen like a little citie: within it selfe, are all the most me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable monuments which any former time hath left worthy to be remƒìbred: after the kings maiesty of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> had taken full view of this goodly castle or chief strength of our citie, &amp; what else was thought worthy of his royall presence in the citie, he departed backe to his own court, which then was held at S≈çmerset house in the stand, &amp; fr≈ç thƒìce to white-hal where he lodged.</p>
